A very fast and accurate Bloom Filter implementation in Rust.


### Usage

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
b100m-filter = "0.3.0"
```

```rust
use b100m_filter::BloomFilter;

let num_blocks = 4; // by default, each block is 512 bits
let values = vec!["42", "ðŸ¦€"];

let filter = BloomFilter::builder(num_blocks).items(values.iter());
assert!(filter.contains("42"));
assert!(filter.contains("ðŸ¦€"));
```

### Implementation

`b100m-filter` is blazingly fast because it uses L1 cache friendly blocks and efficiently derives many index bits from only one hash per value. Compared to traditional implementations, `b100m-filter` is 5-13 times faster for small sets of items, and hundreds of times faster for larger item sets. In all cases, `b100m-filter` maintains competitive false positive rates.

### Runtime Performance

Runtime comparison to other bloom filter crates:
- Bloom memory size = 16Kb
- 1000 contained items
- 364 hashes per item
  
|  | Check Non-Existing (ns) | Check Existing (ns) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| b100m-filter | 16.900 | 139.62 |
| *fastbloom-rs | 35.358 | 485.81 |
| bloom | 66.136 | 749.27 |
| bloomfilter | 68.912 | 996.56 |
| probabilistic-collections | 83.385 | 974.67 |

*fastbloom-rs uses XXHash, which is faster than SipHash.

### False Positive Performance

`b100m-filter` does not sacrifice accuracy. Below is a comparison false positive rate with other bloom filter crates:

### Memory and False Positive Rate

As the number of bits and set size increase, traditional bloom filters need to perform more hashes per item to keep false positive rates low. However, `b100m-filter`'s optimal number of hashes is bounded while keeping near zero rates even for many items:

>
> (Bloom filter speed is directly proportional to number of hashes)
